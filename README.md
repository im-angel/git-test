# Git_Test
## Introduction
### Hi!
I am **Angel** and this is my first (not counting the one with an unfixable mistake) repository.\
Its only purpose is to give me – or *anyone* for that matter – a space for practicing **Git**.

I don't really expect *anyone* to stumble upon this repo, however I can't rule out the possibility, hence the reason for this introduction.

*Again*, not necessarily possible, but if you do end up here, I would like to provide the chance to practice, as well as the resources I use(d) in my journey.

## Contributions
 No matter your experience this is a safe space for you too practice **Git** with me :)

For the commands you will use the most I recommend The Odin Project (I'll come back to this in a bit) to teach you that.\
As well as looking up what specific commands mean if the provided explanation is not giving enough context for you.
- For me doing those helped me remember them

## Resources

### Studying
For studying I definitely recommend these two websites:
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
- [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com)

They both provide theory and practice for free.\
This is thanks to all the support, donations and contributions.

With [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) practice can be done on the website itself.\
In the beginning you can choose from different "courses" to take.\
There are Certification projects at the ends of different parts and a Certification Exam at the end, which – naturally – provides a Certification in the end.

The [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com) recommends using <ins>VS Code</ins> for coding and it's not possible on the website itself (as far as I know).\
In the <ins>Foundation</ins> course it also provides a full and (mostly) understandable **Git** download and usage tutorial as well as a <ins>Discord</ins>  community full of nice and helpful people.

### Coding
For coding I recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\
It's free to use with a bunch of helpful extensions you can download.

And here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU) for an introduction to HTML and CSS and the use of <ins>VS Code.</ins> I found it really helpful.

#### Extensions I use in VS Code
- <ins>Material Icon Theme</ins>
  - This makes it easier to navigate between files
- <ins>Live Preview</ins>
  - Shows a live preview of what you are coding
- <ins>HTML Format</ins> (by Mohamed Akram)
  - I use this instead of Prettier
- <ins>Error Lens</ins>
  - Shows errors inline
- <ins>codachi</ins>
  - Emotional Support and Motivational little friend
  - 100% necessary in my opinion
- <ins>CodeSnap</ins> and <ins>Easy CodeSnap</ins>
  - Makes it easy to share your code as a ScreenShot
  - The background color is customisable (with a bit of struggle), there are videos on how to do it
